Bio/ConnectDots version 1.0.2
================================

Connect the Dots is a general data integration framework targeted 
at translating biological identifiers across multiple transitive databases.
It uses a small query language so that users can easily join database sources
(like Unigene, Swissprot, etc) and then create translation tables for 
the identifiers and fields in those databases. Parsers for most biological
databases are included. See docs/ConnectDots.html for usage details.
